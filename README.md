# Shared Script Kit Kenv

The recommended process is to use the url and clone this kenv into your main kenv.

Node version 16 is needed for the `postprepare` script to copy over all of the images.

## Setup

Make sure you have added `kit` to your cli.

Once this kenv is cloned into your run `npm run postprepare` this will copy all of the files into the parent asset directory.

## Developent

There is a current script called `getIcons` that gets the browser logos from an npm package. This will be upgraded in the future to support more icons natively.
